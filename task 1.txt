HTTP/1.1: For better understanding, letâ€™s assume the situation when you make a request to the server for the geeksforgeeks.
html page & server responds to you as a resource geeksforgeeks.
html page before sending the request and the response there is a TCP connection established between client & server

HTTP/2: HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol
HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format.
it works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests.

HTTP/1.1 it works textual formatand http/2 works on the binary protocol.

HTTP/1.1 there is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn't get its all resources.
HTTP/2 it allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiplre requests.

HTTP/1.1 it compress data by itself.
HTTP/2 it uses HPACK for data compession.
