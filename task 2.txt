Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored.

Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

An object method is an object property containing a function definition.
The following example also creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:
        var person = new Object();
        person.firstName = “John”;
        person.lastName = “Doe”;
        person.age = 50;
        person.eyeColor = “blue”;

Internally, JavaScript engines use various data structures to represent objects efficiently. 
One common approach is using a hash table or a similar structure to store the object’s properties and their corresponding values.
